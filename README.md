# Data-Cleaning-
In this Repository i have done some methods of data cleaning 
I also provide the data on which i have performed the data cleaning 


***Data Cleaning Steps:
    1)Import Dataset
    2)Merge datasets into one dataset
    3)identify errors
    4)Standardize process
    5)scrub for duplicates
    6)validate accuracy 
    
* What is missing Value/Data ? 
In the variable or any observation, values are not stored called as 
missing values/ data

* Methods to handle missing values 
1. Ignore missing values / Delete Row
2. fill missing value manually
3. global constant
4. measure of central tendency (Mean, Midian & Mode)
5. Measure of central tendecncy for each class
5. Most probable value (ML algorithm)
